# QR Code Generator

A simple Node.js application that generates QR codes from URLs entered by the user.

## Features

- Interactive command-line interface using Inquirer
- Generates QR code images from URLs
- Saves the entered URL to a text file for reference
- Uses ES6 modules for modern JavaScript syntax

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 14 or higher)
- npm (comes with Node.js)

## Installation

1. Clone or download this project
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

1. Start the application:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   node index.js
   ```

2. When prompted, enter the URL you want to convert to a QR code
3. The application will:
   - Generate a QR code image saved as `qr_img.png`
   - Save the URL to `URL.txt` for future reference

## Output Files
